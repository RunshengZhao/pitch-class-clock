# bugs
the "rotate as inversions" doesn't work intuitively if user don't select "1", it will still rotate, but it is confusing. so when checked, and user click rotate right or left. it should check if the user highlight "1" or not. if not, refuse to rotate. 

## spacing inconsistent
after rotating, the spacing with listing cannot stay consistent.

# What to do next.

## Add triads, 4-note-universe!!!

## Add convert function
let the user define what 1 is, then convert the number back to letters.
